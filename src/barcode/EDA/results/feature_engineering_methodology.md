## Theoretical Foundation

### Vector Space Representation Theory

The feature engineering framework is grounded in vector space representation theory, where each barcode scan event is transformed into a high-dimensional feature vector capturing:

**Temporal Dynamics**: Time-series patterns, sequence dependencies, and operational rhythms  
**Spatial Relationships**: Location transitions, geographical constraints, and business process flows  
**Behavioral Signatures**: Statistical patterns, frequency distributions, and anomaly indicators  

### Mathematical Framework

Let **x** ∈ ℝ^d represent a feature vector for barcode scan event i, where:

```
x_i = [f_temporal(e_i), f_spatial(e_i), f_behavioral(e_i)]
```

Where:
- f_temporal: Temporal feature extraction function
- f_spatial: Spatial feature extraction function  
- f_behavioral: Behavioral feature extraction function
- e_i: Raw event data for scan i

The feature engineering process transforms raw event data E = {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n} into feature matrix X ∈ ℝ^{n×d} optimized for anomaly detection algorithms.

## Feature Engineering Architecture

### 1. Temporal Feature Extraction

**Objective**: Capture time-dependent patterns and sequence anomalies in supply chain operations.

#### 1.1 Basic Temporal Features
```python
# Time components for operational context
features = ['hour', 'day_of_week', 'day_of_month', 'month']

# Business context indicators
binary_flags = ['is_weekend', 'is_business_hours', 'night_scan']
```

**Academic Justification**: Supply chain operations follow predictable temporal patterns. Deviations from normal operational hours, weekend activities, or unusual timing patterns often indicate anomalous behavior.

#### 1.2 Time Gap Analysis (Critical for Anomaly Detection)
```python
# Calculate inter-event time gaps
df['time_gap_seconds'] = (
    df['event_time'] - df.groupby('epc_code')['event_time'].shift(1)
).dt.total_seconds()

# Statistical transformation for anomaly detection
df['time_gap_log'] = np.log1p(df['time_gap_seconds'].fillna(0))
df['time_gap_zscore'] = df.groupby('epc_code')['time_gap_seconds'].transform(
    lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / x.std() if x.std() > 0 else 0
)
```

**Mathematical Foundation**: Time gaps follow heavy-tailed distributions in supply chain operations. Log transformation normalizes the distribution, while z-score normalization enables statistical outlier detection.

#### 1.3 Velocity and Frequency Features
```python
# Operational velocity indicators
df['events_per_hour'] = df.groupby(['epc_code', df['event_time'].dt.floor('H')])['epc_code'].transform('count')
df['events_per_day'] = df.groupby(['epc_code', df['event_time'].dt.date])['epc_code'].transform('count')
```

**Domain Relevance**: Unusually high scan frequencies may indicate scanning errors, while unusually low frequencies may indicate process delays or missing scans.

#### 1.4 Sequence Position Analysis
```python
# Position within EPC lifecycle
df['scan_sequence_position'] = df.groupby('epc_code').cumcount() + 1
df['total_scans_for_epc'] = df.groupby('epc_code')['epc_code'].transform('count')
df['scan_progress_ratio'] = df['scan_sequence_position'] / df['total_scans_for_epc']
```

**Anomaly Detection Value**: Events occurring out of expected sequence order or at unusual lifecycle stages indicate potential anomalies.

### 2. Spatial Feature Extraction

**Objective**: Capture location-based patterns and geographical anomalies in supply chain movements.

#### 2.1 Location Transition Analysis
```python
# Location sequence tracking
df['prev_location_id'] = df.groupby('epc_code')['location_id'].shift(1)
df['location_changed'] = (df['location_id'] != df['prev_location_id']).astype(int)

# Backtracking detection (potential anomaly indicator)
df['location_backtrack'] = (
    (df['location_id'] == df.groupby('epc_code')['location_id'].shift(2)) &
    (df['location_id'] != df['prev_location_id'])
).astype(int)
```

**Academic Foundation**: Supply chain movements follow directed acyclic graphs. Backtracking or circular movements often indicate process violations or fraudulent activity.

#### 2.2 Business Process Progression
```python
# Business step ordering validation
business_step_order = {
    'Factory': 1, 'WMS': 2, 'Logistics_HUB': 3, 
    'Distribution': 4, 'Retail': 5, 'Customer': 6
}

df['business_step_numeric'] = df['business_step'].map(business_step_order)
df['business_step_regression'] = (
    df['business_step_numeric'] < 
    df.groupby('epc_code')['business_step_numeric'].shift(1)
).astype(int)
```

**Supply Chain Logic**: Products should progress forward through business steps. Regression indicates potential process violations or counterfeit insertion.

#### 2.3 Transition Probability Features
```python
def calculate_transition_probabilities(df):
    transitions = df.dropna(subset=['prev_location_id', 'location_id'])
    transition_counts = transitions.groupby(['prev_location_id', 'location_id']).size()
    location_totals = transitions.groupby('prev_location_id').size()
    
    transition_probs = {}
    for (from_loc, to_loc), count in transition_counts.items():
        prob = count / location_totals[from_loc]
        transition_probs[(from_loc, to_loc)] = prob
    
    return transition_probs
```

**Statistical Foundation**: Rare transitions (low probability) indicate unusual movement patterns potentially associated with anomalous behavior.

### 3. Behavioral Feature Extraction

**Objective**: Capture statistical patterns and behavioral signatures for anomaly detection.

#### 3.1 EPC-Level Aggregation Features
```python
# Statistical summaries per EPC
epc_stats = df.groupby('epc_code').agg({
    'location_id': ['nunique', 'count'],
    'time_gap_seconds': ['mean', 'std', 'min', 'max'],
    'business_step': 'nunique',
    'operator_id': 'nunique',
    'device_id': 'nunique'
})
```

**Academic Justification**: Aggregation features capture global patterns per EPC, enabling detection of EPCs with unusual overall behavior patterns.

#### 3.2 Entropy-Based Features
```python
def calculate_entropy(series):
    value_counts = series.value_counts(normalize=True)
    return -np.sum(value_counts * np.log2(value_counts + 1e-10))

df['location_entropy'] = df.groupby('epc_code')['location_id'].transform(calculate_entropy)
df['time_entropy'] = df.groupby('epc_code')['hour'].transform(calculate_entropy)
```

**Information Theory Foundation**: Shannon entropy quantifies the unpredictability of location and timing patterns. High entropy may indicate chaotic or anomalous behavior.

#### 3.3 Statistical Outlier Detection
```python
# IQR-based outlier detection
for col in numerical_cols:
    Q1 = df[col].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df[col].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
    
    df[f'{col}_outlier'] = (
        (df[col] < lower_bound) | (df[col] > upper_bound)
    ).astype(int)
```

**Statistical Foundation**: Interquartile range (IQR) method provides robust outlier detection less sensitive to extreme values than standard deviation methods.

## Dimensionality Reduction and Vector Space Optimization

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Objective**: Reduce feature dimensionality while preserving information content for efficient anomaly detection.

#### Mathematical Framework
```python
# Standardization for unbiased PCA
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# PCA with variance explanation
pca = PCA()
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Optimal component selection (80% variance threshold)
cumvar = np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
n_components_80 = np.argmax(cumvar >= 0.8) + 1
```

**Academic Justification**: PCA identifies linear combinations of features that maximize variance explanation. The 80% variance threshold balances information retention with computational efficiency.

### t-SNE for Visualization and Cluster Analysis

**Implementation**:
```python
# Non-linear dimensionality reduction for visualization
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=42, perplexity=30)
X_tsne = tsne.fit_transform(X_scaled)
```

**Research Application**: t-SNE reveals non-linear structure in feature space, enabling visualization of anomaly clusters and validation of feature effectiveness.

**Variance Analysis**: Features with near-zero variance are removed to eliminate non-informative dimensions.

**Correlation Analysis**: Highly correlated features (r > 0.95) are identified for potential removal to reduce multicollinearity.

**Distribution Analysis**: Feature distributions are analyzed for skewness and heavy tails, informing appropriate transformation strategies.

### 2. Domain Validation

**Business Logic Consistency**: Features are validated against supply chain domain knowledge and operational constraints.

**Expert Review**: Feature engineering decisions are documented for domain expert validation.

**Anomaly Relevance**: Each feature's contribution to anomaly detection is theoretically justified and empirically validated.

### 3. Computational Validation

**Scalability Testing**: Feature extraction pipeline tested on datasets up to 1M records for production readiness.

**Memory Efficiency**: Memory usage optimized through efficient data structures and incremental processing.

**Reproducibility**: All random processes use fixed seeds for reproducible results.
