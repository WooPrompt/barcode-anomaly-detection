### 10-Step Plan After EDA for Barcode Log Anomaly Detection

1. **Define Anomaly Types & Detection Goals**

   * Clarify what anomalies matter (e.g., EPC forgery, impossible transitions, timing errors).
   * Define success criteria and evaluation metrics.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Extract relevant features from raw barcode logs (e.g., time gaps, location transitions, frequency counts).
   * Create domain-specific features (e.g., transition probabilities, unusual movement flags).

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing or inconsistent data found during EDA.
   * Normalize or standardize numerical features as needed.
   * Encode categorical features properly.

4. **Class Imbalance Handling**

   * Assess anomaly class imbalance.
   * Apply techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, or class weighting.

5. **Select & Train Anomaly Detection Models**

   * Choose algorithms suited for anomalies (e.g., One-Class SVM, Isolation Forest, Autoencoders).
   * Train models on the feature set.

6. **Model Validation & Tuning**

   * Use cross-validation, grid search or Bayesian optimization to tune hyperparameters.
   * Evaluate with precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, etc.

7. **Integrate Rule-Based Detection**

   * Implement domain rules discovered during EDA (e.g., impossible location jumps).
   * Combine rule-based flags with model predictions.

8. **Build Real-Time or Batch Inference Pipeline**

   * Design pipeline for feeding new barcode logs into the detection system.
   * Ensure scalability and latency requirements are met.

9. **Alerting & Visualization**

   * Create dashboards or alerts for detected anomalies.
   * Provide actionable insights for end users.

10. **Continuous Monitoring & Feedback Loop**

    * Monitor model performance over time.
    * Incorporate user feedback and new labeled anomalies to retrain models.
