## knowns
- Duplicate detection based on same EPC at different locations with same timestamp
- Uses pandas DataFrame with epc_code, scan_location, event_time columns
- Need to return anomaly list and execution time
- Focuses on impossible simultaneous scans

## unknowns (answer Yes/No)
- Should scans within the same second be considered duplicates?
- Should duplicate detection ignore timezone differences?
- Should same EPC at same location with same time be flagged?
- Should the function handle missing timestamp values?
- Should microsecond precision be used for duplicate detection?
