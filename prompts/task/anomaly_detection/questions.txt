1. Do all anomaly functions operate independently or are there dependencies?
2. Which column combinations best identify each anomaly type?
3. How much variation in runtime exists between small vs large input sizes?
4. What is the expected threshold for "too slow"?
5. Are edge cases (e.g. duplicate EPCs with same timestamp) already covered in test data?
