## knowns
- Location hierarchy: Factory(0) → Logistics(1) → Wholesale(2) → Retail(3)
- Normal flow is downstream (lower to higher numbers)
- Reverse flow should be flagged as error
- Uses scan_location column to determine hierarchy level
- Korean location names (공장, 물류센터, 도매상, 소매상)

## unknowns (answer Yes/No)
- Should movement between same-level locations be flagged?
- Should case sensitivity matter for location names?
- Should unknown location names default to error level?
- Should single-scan EPCs be excluded from location error detection?
- Should the function handle null/NaN location values?
