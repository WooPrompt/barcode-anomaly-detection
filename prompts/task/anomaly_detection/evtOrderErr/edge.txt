## Edge Cases for detect_evt_order_err

1.  **Missing Event Types:** What if `event_type` is null, NaN, or an empty string?
-Flag it if the row doesn't fulfill the criteria.

2.  **Unrecognized Event Types:** How should the function handle event types that are not 'Inbound' or 'Outbound' (e.g., 'Aggregation', 'Packing')?
-The full sequence is Aggregation>WMS_Inbound>WMS_Outbound>HUB_Inbound>HUB_Outbound>W_Stock_Inbound>W_Stock_Outbound>R_Stock_Inbound>R_Stock_Outbound>POS_Sell
However, some products stop mid-sequence and remain in stock.

3.  **Multiple 'Inbound' or 'Outbound' Events:** Is it an error to have two 'Inbound' events in a row at the same location? Or two 'Outbound' events?
-It's an error.

4.  **Case Sensitivity:** Are event types case-sensitive (e.g., 'inbound' vs. 'Inbound')?
-No.

5.  **Events at Different Locations:** The rule should only apply to events at the *same* location. How do we ensure this?
-Could you clarify what this case is referring to?

6.  **Single Event for EPC:** An EPC with only one event cannot have an `evtOrderErr`.
-If it's factory, ignore it. But it's not, flag it.

7.  **Events with Same Timestamp:** What if an 'Inbound' and 'Outbound' event occur at the exact same time at the same location? Is this an error?
-You don't need to care about time. That will be detected by Jump(spatial-temporal abnormal) function.

8.  **Partial Keywords:** What if an event type is 'Partial Outbound'? Should this be treated the same as 'Outbound'?
Some items may be left behind, but the exact quantity isn't important. Focus only on the event sequence. 

9.  **Interleaved Events:** What if the sequence is Inbound -> Other -> Outbound? Is this valid?
-No, flag it. 

10. **Data Sorting:** This rule is highly dependent on the data being correctly sorted by time. What happens if the sort is incorrect?
-Stick to the time-based sorting, If the time label is incorrect, it is abnormal anyway. So whether it's flagged multiple times doesn't matter.
