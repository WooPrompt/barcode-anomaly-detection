## knowns
- Valid event sequence: Inbound → Outbound at same location
- Multiple consecutive Inbound or Outbound events are errors
- Event types: Aggregation, WMS_Inbound, WMS_Outbound, HUB_Inbound, etc.
- Focus on event sequence logic within same location
- Case insensitive event type matching

## unknowns (answer Yes/No)
- Should events with null/empty event_type be flagged?
- Should partial keyword matching be used (e.g., "Partial_Outbound" → "Outbound")?
- Should unrecognized event types be automatically flagged?
- Should single-event EPCs be excluded from order error detection?
- Should the function handle events with identical timestamps?
