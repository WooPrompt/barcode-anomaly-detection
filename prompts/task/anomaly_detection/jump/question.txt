## knowns
- Uses statistical baselines from business_step_transition_avg_v2.csv
- Compares actual travel time vs. expected transition time
- Requires geospatial coordinates from location_id_withGeospatial.csv
- Flags travel times that are statistically impossible
- Uses Z-score or similar statistical methods

## unknowns (answer Yes/No)
- Should missing location coordinates exclude records from jump detection? **Yes** - Cannot calculate travel time
- Should same-location scans be excluded from travel time analysis? **Yes** - Zero travel time expected
- Should weekend/holiday periods use different statistical thresholds? **No** - Business data shows consistent patterns
- Should the function handle negative time differences? **Yes** - Flag as impossible travel
- Should travel times beyond 3 standard deviations be automatically flagged? **Yes** - Statistical outlier threshold
