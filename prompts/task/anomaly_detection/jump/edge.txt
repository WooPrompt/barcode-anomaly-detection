## Edge Cases for detect_jump_anomalies

1. **Extremely Fast Travel:** Should travel times significantly faster than physically possible be flagged?

2. **Very Slow Travel:** Should travel times much slower than the statistical average be flagged?

3. **Missing Location Coordinates:** Should scans at locations without GPS coordinates be handled differently?

4. **Same Location Travel Time:** Should zero travel time between scans at the same location be flagged?

5. **Statistical Outliers:** Should travel times beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean be flagged?

6. **Weekend/Holiday Travel:** Should longer travel times during non-business days be treated differently?

7. **Cross-Country Jumps:** Should travel between very distant locations within short time be flagged?

8. **Backwards Time Travel:** Should events with negative time differences be flagged as jump anomalies?

9. **Missing Transition Data:** Should locations without historical transition data be excluded from jump detection?

10. **Transportation Mode Changes:** Should sudden changes in travel speed patterns be considered jump anomalies?
