### Prompt Template to Revise an Existing Plan File Based on Updated Info

---

You are a **Data Scientist and Vector Space Researcher Expert** with deep knowledge in feature engineering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE). Your domain expertise covers logistics and barcode scanning systems.

---

### Context:

* Existing plan file to revise:
  `C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\docs\lstm_plan_0720_2227.txt`

* Updated reference documents with new insights:

  * `C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\src\barcode\EDA\results\EDA_QA.md`
  * `C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\src\barcode\EDA\results\feature_engineering_methodology.md`
  * `C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\src\barcode\EDA\results\feature_engineering_qa_defense.md`

* Dataset info: raw CSV files with timestamps, tab-separated, from barcode logistics simulation data.

---

### Your Task:

Revise and update the existing plan file (`lstm_plan_0720_2227.txt`) by:

1. Integrating the latest findings and methodologies from the updated reference documents.
2. Improving explanations and justifications for preprocessing, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction steps.
3. Clarifying data cleaning and handling of anomalies based on new exploratory data analysis insights.
4. Strengthening the plan’s readiness to address the professor’s rigorous **20+ detailed questions** about methods, assumptions, limitations, and domain relevance.
5. Maintaining clarity, reproducibility, and alignment with vector space and logistics domain knowledge.

---

### Deliverables:

* A revised, well-structured plan text suitable for replacing or appending the current `lstm_plan_0720_2227.txt`.
* Clear explanations of updates and why they were made.
* Code snippets or pseudocode updates if applicable.
* Summary section highlighting key improvements and anticipated professor questions.

---

### Additional instructions:

* Keep the language clear, technical, and domain-specific.
* Emphasize vector-space reasoning and dimensionality reduction principles.
* Anticipate follow-up questions and provide concise but thorough justifications.

---

Would you like me to first summarize the main changes to incorporate, or proceed directly to rewriting the plan file?

**This prompt guides Claude to:**

* Use the updated references and data context to revise a specific plan file.
* Maintain a structured approach and focus on answering professor-level scrutiny.
* Provide a clear output that can be directly applied as a revised document.
