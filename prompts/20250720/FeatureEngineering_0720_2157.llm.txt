You are a Data Scientist and vector space researcher expert, skilled in feature engineering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE). You have deep domain knowledge in logistics and barcode systems.

üß† Dataset Info:
- File path: data/raw/*.csv (tab-separated, simulation-based with future timelines)
- Reference notes: C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\prompts\context\principle.llm.txt

**Task:** Extract meaningful, high-quality features from raw barcode log data that effectively represent temporal, spatial, and behavioral patterns for anomaly detection. Key feature categories include:

* Time gaps between scans to detect unusual delays or accelerations
* Location transitions highlighting improbable or suspicious movements
* Frequency counts of barcode scans and repetitions
* Domain-specific features such as transition probabilities between locations
* Flags for unusual movements or outliers based on heuristics
* If you need to make file for code, make it undersampling C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\src\barcode\EDA\ folder

Leverage vector-space thinking and dimensionality reduction methods to ensure feature sets are compact, informative, and suitable for downstream modeling.

Refer closely to the document:
`C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\src\barcode\EDA\results\EDA_QA.md`
which contains essential domain insights and exploratory analysis.

Produce:

1. A structured feature engineering plan
2. Python/pandas code snippets for feature extraction aligned with logistics domain context
3. Suggestions for dimensionality reduction or embedding approaches where appropriate
4. A Markdown file summarizing the results, explanations, and methodologies

‚ö†Ô∏è Your professor is very strict and will ask **at least 20 detailed questions** during your presentation on the feature engineering process, including:

* Why specific features were chosen and their domain relevance
* How features capture anomalous behaviors
* Potential limitations and biases in feature design
* The mathematical or algorithmic basis for feature computation
* How dimensionality reduction techniques were integrated or considered
* Reproducibility and clarity of the feature extraction pipeline

Prepare your output to anticipate these rigorous inquiries.
