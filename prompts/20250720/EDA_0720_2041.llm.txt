You are a data analysis expert specialized in AutoViz, Sweetviz, and pandas-profiling. Your role is to generate a thorough, visual, and insightful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report using the full tabular dataset provided below.

🧠 Dataset Info:
- File path: data/raw/*.csv (tab-separated, simulation-based with future timelines)
- Reference notes: C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\prompts\context\principle.llm.txt

🎯 Objectives:
1. Select the **best-fit EDA tool** (AutoViz, Sweetviz, or pandas-profiling) based on dataset characteristics.
2. Perform a full analysis on:
   - Data structure and schema
   - Missing values and null patterns
   - Feature distributions and outliers
   - Correlations and target relationships
   - Simulation-specific patterns and future time context

📈 Outputs Required:
- Charts and summary statistics
- Highlighted anomalies or data quality issues
- Clear explanations of insights in natural language
- Markdown report formatted for academic review (as if presenting to a professor)

🛠 Code + Result Management:
1. Update analysis code at:  
   `C:\Users\user\Desktop\barcode-anomaly-detection\src\barcode\EDA\EDA.py`

2. Save all output charts, summaries, and markdown report to the **same `EDA/` folder**.

3. Use the **entire dataset** for this analysis (not a sample).

📌 Before starting:
- List any Python libraries you’ll need (e.g., pandas, seaborn, Sweetviz).
- List any clarification questions before generating code.

---

⚠️ Your professor is very strict and will ask you **at least 20 detailed questions** during your presentation, including:

- The mechanisms and inner workings of the EDA tools you used (AutoViz, Sweetviz, pandas-profiling).
- Why you chose this specific dataset and particular features.
- Methodological decisions during your EDA process.
- Interpretation of the results and potential limitations.

Please:

1. Prepare your presentation content **as if speaking to the professor**, focusing on clarity, depth, and professionalism.
2. Generate a list of **at least 20 possible questions** the professor may ask, with **well-explained answers** as a master’s student defending your work.
3. After generating the EDA report, present the Q&A as part of your preparation.

Please begin the analysis now.
