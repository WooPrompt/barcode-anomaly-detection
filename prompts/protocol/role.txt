üîç Best Fit for Feature Engineering Task:
1. Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer

Strong expertise in feature extraction and transformation, especially from sequential/log data.

Experience working with time-series, event logs, or RFID/barcode tracking datasets.

Skilled in domain-specific feature design (e.g., transition probabilities, temporal patterns).

Familiarity with Python data libraries (pandas, NumPy), and feature engineering tools.

2. Domain Expert in Supply Chain / Logistics Analytics

Deep understanding of barcode systems, supply chain processes, and typical anomalies.

Able to advise on meaningful domain-specific features to capture realistic anomalies.

3. Data Engineer (if scale and pipeline integration are critical)

Ability to automate feature extraction at scale for large streaming or batch data.

Experience with ETL pipelines and distributed data processing (e.g., Apache Beam, Spark).
