## protocol
learning
- Always ask me where to insert new code and explain why.
- Provide 2–3 code options if possible, with short pros/cons so I can learn.
- Don’t assume I already know the repo or tech.
- Guide me step-by-step in small, clear plans (plan mode).
- Help me rollback safely and commit with confidence after success.
- Never omit the actual code in replies. Show full, readable examples.
