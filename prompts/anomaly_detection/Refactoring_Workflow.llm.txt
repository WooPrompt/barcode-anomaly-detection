## AI Refactoring Workflow Prompt

### 2. Benchmarking
- For each function (`def`) before refactoring, run performance and correctness benchmarks.
- Record all benchmark results and notes for future reference.

### 3. Automated Refactoring Sequence
- After benchmarking, proceed directly to refactoring the next function.
- Do not prompt or ask for additional confirmation before moving on.

### Edge Case Handling
- When refactoring a new function, always generate 10 edge case assumption scenarios.
  - Each scenario should describe a situation where the function may fail, behave unexpectedly, or encounter trouble (e.g., invalid input, boundary values, resource limits, etc.).
- Append these 10 edge case scenarios to the `edge.txt` file after each refactoring.

**Instructions for AI:**
- Strictly follow this workflow: benchmark → memo → refactor next function (no confirmation) → generate and save 10 edge case scenarios per function.
- Maintain and update `edge.txt` with all edge case scenarios as you progress.
