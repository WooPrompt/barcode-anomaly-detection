## DECISION: AI Handoff System Design

**Date**: 2025-07-12
**Problem**: Long conversations, complex folder structures, token inefficiency for AI context
**Solution**: Single ai_handoff.txt file + simple working/ structure

### WHAT WAS DECIDED
- Create ai_handoff.txt as THE master context file for any new AI
- Use working/ folder for daily operations (decisions/, conversations/, requirements/)
- Target <500 tokens for complete project understanding
- Auto-update system for maintaining currency

### WHY THIS APPROACH
- **Token efficiency**: One small file vs multiple large files
- **Context preservation**: Complete understanding without folder diving
- **Easy handoff**: "Read @ai_handoff.txt and help with [task]"
- **Simple maintenance**: Update one file vs complex folder management

### CONVERSATION FLOW THAT LED HERE
User: "Minor Areas for Enhancement" → Need testing frameworks
↓
AI: Proposed complex folder structure for testing
↓  
User: "Too complex... want one file for AI understanding"
↓
AI: Suggested master_context.txt approach
↓
User: Simplified to ai_handoff.txt + working/ folders
↓
**DECISION**: Minimal viable solution for AI context handoff

### IMPLEMENTATION
1. ✅ Created prompts/ai_handoff.txt
2. ✅ Created working/ folder structure  
3. ⏳ Auto-JSON for maintenance
4. ⏳ Move existing files to working/

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- New AI can understand project in <500 tokens
- Context handoff takes one command: "Read @ai_handoff.txt"
- Maintenance is simple and automated
- Decision history is preserved but not overwhelming

**This decision itself demonstrates the prompt engineering optimization we're building.**
