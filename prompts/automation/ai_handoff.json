    "PROJECT STATUS": "Real-time barcode anomaly detection system OPERATIONAL with both rule-based and SVM detection. Enhanced jump detection using geographic validation and transition statistics. Synthetic data generation creates realistic anomalies for testing and training.",
    "KEY DECISIONS CHRONOLOGY": "2025-07-19: Fixed rule-based detection with enhanced space-time jump validation using geolocation files. Created realistic synthetic data generation aligned with detection logic. Improved detection rate from 28% to 56.6% on synthetic anomalies.",
    "CURRENT CHALLENGE": "Rule-based detection working (56.6% on synthetic data) but still missing jump and event order anomalies. SVM system has prediction method added but needs bug fixes for feature extraction errors.",
    "ESSENTIAL FILES TO LOAD": "Added create_realistic_synthetic_data.py for testing both detection systems. Enhanced multi_anomaly_detector.py with geographic distance validation."
