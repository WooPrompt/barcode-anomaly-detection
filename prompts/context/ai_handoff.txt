# AI HANDOFF - COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT [2025-07-13]

## PROJECT STATUS
Building real-time barcode anomaly detection system. 5 detection functions complete (epcFake, epcDup, locErr, evtOrderErr, jump). Automation system operational with init.json workflow. Function modularization started with epcFake_structure_check.py.

## FRAMEWORKS DEVELOPED
1. **question_loop.llm.txt** - AI must ask clarifying questions before coding
2. **analysis_log_behavior.llm.txt** - Context accumulation and decision tracking  
3. **principle.llm.txt** - Project principles and environment setup
4. **automation system** - Session lifecycle management (init.json → work → ai_handoff.json)

## KEY DECISIONS CHRONOLOGY
- 2025-07-10: Modularized detection into 5 standalone functions
- 2025-07-11: Statistical approach (Z-score) over pure rule-based
- 2025-07-12: Need automated testing for prompt framework effectiveness
- 2025-07-13: **CURRENT FOCUS** - Built automation system with Meta→Templates→Tasks flow, created function-specific question.txt files

## CURRENT CHALLENGE
Function modularization into individual files with runtime benchmarking. Each anomaly type needs separate .py file following {type}_{approach}.py naming convention.

## USER WORKING STYLE
- Always ask clarifying questions first (use question_loop.llm.txt)
- Reference previous decisions (check analysis_log_behavior.llm.txt)
- Build incrementally with performance measurement
- Use English for technical, Korean for complex explanations
- Document decisions and commit milestones

## ESSENTIAL FILES TO LOAD
- @prompts/automation/init.json - Session initialization
- @prompts/protocol/question_loop.llm.txt - Systematic questioning
- @prompts/context/principle.llm.txt - Project specifications
- @prompts/log/function_generation_20250713.txt - Latest progress

## HOW TO START
1. Run @prompts/automation/init.json for full session setup
2. Apply question_loop protocol for any new task  
3. Use automation/ai_handoff.json to update this file after major decisions
4. Keep token usage minimal, decisions measurable

## AUTOMATION WORKFLOW
- **Entry**: @prompts/automation/init.json (loads context, applies protocols, updates metadata)
- **Work**: Function generation in prompts/task/anomaly_detection/{type}/
- **Exit**: @prompts/automation/ai_handoff.json (updates this file, logs decisions)

**Magic phrase for new AI:** "Run @prompts/automation/init.json and then help me with [current task]"
