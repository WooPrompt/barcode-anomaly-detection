# AI HANDOFF - COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT [2025-07-12]

## PROJECT STATUS
Building real-time barcode anomaly detection system. 5 detection functions complete (epcFake, epcDup, locErr, evtOrderErr, jump). Next: SVM/GNN models + automated testing.

## FRAMEWORKS DEVELOPED
1. **question_loop.llm.txt** - AI must ask clarifying questions before coding
2. **analysis_log_behavior.llm.txt** - Context accumulation and decision tracking  
3. **principle.llm.txt** - Project principles and environment setup

## KEY DECISIONS CHRONOLOGY
- 2025-07-10: Modularized detection into 5 standalone functions
- 2025-07-11: Statistical approach (Z-score) over pure rule-based
- 2025-07-12: **CURRENT FOCUS** - Need automated testing for prompt framework effectiveness

## CURRENT CHALLENGE
Testing whether prompt frameworks actually improve AI performance vs baseline. Move from "seems good" to measurable metrics.

## USER WORKING STYLE
- Always ask clarifying questions first (use question_loop.llm.txt)
- Reference previous decisions (check analysis_log_behavior.llm.txt)
- Build incrementally with performance measurement
- Use English for technical, Korean for complex explanations
- Document decisions and commit milestones

## ESSENTIAL FILES TO LOAD
- @prompts/protocol/question_loop.llm.txt
- @prompts/log/[latest_analysis].txt
- @prompts/project/principle.llm.txt

## HOW TO START
1. Load files above for context
2. Apply question_loop protocol for any new task
3. Update this file after major decisions
4. Keep token usage minimal, decisions measurable

**Magic phrase for new AI:** "Read @ai_handoff.txt and then help me with [current task]"
