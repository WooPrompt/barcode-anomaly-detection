  - CRITICAL FIX: JSON serialization error (numpy int64 → Python int) blocking all predictions
  - CRITICAL FIX: Field mapping inconsistency (location_id → reader_location) causing feature extraction failures

    - PM_INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md with talking points and Q&A preparation
    - business_explanation.txt with comprehensive ROI analysis and technical justification
    - Simple run scripts: train_model.py, predict_anomalies.py, working_demo.py (fixed calibration)
    - ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Original quick_demo.py has 100% false positive rate - replaced with working_demo.py for realistic results

## CURRENT CHALLENGE
**PM INTERVIEW PREPARATION (3 DAYS LEFT)**: Complete production system ready but demo calibration needs fixing. IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES: (1) Fix demo calibration issue (working_demo.py created as replacement), (2) Practice PM presentation using business_explanation.txt and PM_INTERVIEW_GUIDE.md, (3) Fallback to existing SVM results if LSTM demo fails, (4) Focus on business value and ROI rather than technical perfection. All detection systems operational - Rule-based (56.6%), SVM (recovered), LSTM (production-ready with 893K real data training capability).

## USER WORKING STYLE

- Reference previous decisions (check analysis_log_behavior.llm.txt)
- Build incrementally with performance measurement
