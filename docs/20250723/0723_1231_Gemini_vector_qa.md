Role: You are writing a thesis in GNN and Transformer model.

Questions
1. Is edges defined by my will? of course we need to consider latent vector(columns) but choosing which features amongs this latnet vector (if there are vector for delta_t ,avg_t,etc in latent vector) is my power? or is there a right way ?  
2.  I don't get it. Is it okay to feed another model's latent vector to the other model? 

>Professor's Plan (GNN+Transformer -> Isolation Forest) and Event-Level Detection
Your suspicion is absolutely correct. This architecture is designed for EPC-level (entity-level) anomaly detection, not event-level detection.
Let's walk through that flow:
The Transformer creates a latent vector summarizing the entire sequence for one EPC.
The GNN takes these latent vectors and updates them based on the EPC's "neighbors" in the graph.
The final, GNN-refined latent vector for an EPC is fed into an Isolation Forest.
The Isolation Forest outputs a single score saying how anomalous that entire EPC's journey is.
So, how do we get back to the event level? It's a two-step process:
Step 1 (Detection): Use the GNN->Isolation Forest to identify the anomalous EPCs.
Step 2 (Attribution/Pinpointing): Once an EPC is flagged, you "zoom in" on its timeline. You can then use the attention weights from the original Transformer pass for that EPC. The time steps where the Transformer paid the most attention are likely the root cause of the anomaly. This tells you which events were the most suspicious.
So, you are right to be suspicious. It doesn't detect event-level anomalies directly, but it gives you the tools to find them after the fact.

3. In sequential model, cell state(1 row's feature->vector converted list) affected by weight, in the flow(cell to cell), sometimes some feature vector is dropped, their changing weight. So it goes directly with its previous vector number to next cell-state without changing.. (This is my understanding about dropout ) Is it right? expalin the loss function and other things based on the concept that I gasp.  with visual eg.

4. You said 
> Approach: Transformer First, then GNN (Transformer -> GNN)
Reasoning:
Logical Information Flow: It makes sense to first understand the individual "life story" of each EPC in detail. The Transformer is the expert at this. It reads the sequence and creates a rich, summary vector (the latent vector) that captures the temporal dynamics of that specific EPC.
Rich Node Features: This latent vector is the perfect input for the GNN. You are essentially providing each node in your graph with a highly informative "profile" that summarizes its entire history.
Contextual Refinement: The GNN then takes these rich profiles and refines them based on the "social network." It asks, "Given this EPC's perfect timeline, is it suspicious that it's interacting with these other EPCs?" It updates the latent vectors with this new contextual information.
The alternative (GNN -> Transformer) is less intuitive. It would mean you're modifying an EPC's features based on its neighbors before you've even understood its own timeline, which could muddy the waters.

My confusing is 
- Transformer's latent vector is generated for each EPC code, not event-level. latent vector for each EPC code contains (already affected) the EPC's event level lifespan. SO, GNN is going to receive more less dataset(if  unique EPC is 3000, it will receive 3000 latent vector). Isn't it? 
-If GNN connects the node with edges, how to choose the relationship? Is it going to zoom in the feature vector of specific columns? give me eg. 

5.  Are you(AI) working like this?  you convert my words into pre-defined(as 1 token) vector, and you cut off it or bring whole of a lot of columns(which is same with a lot of dimensions)  into dimensions space, than searching the most similar things, than you brings the that vector groups to somewhere, and caluating which one is most related, then give me the result? 
like row(words) -> vector(by defined token vector number) -> lstm or trnasformer etc pipelines -> latent vector -> compare with the vector with you already trained vector scattered space -> oh these are close to this dimension and this vectors most. take this and give it to the user!

6. If 5. is correct, how do you react like you are surprising when I ask you a question ? How do you act like you understand the previous context? even you still contain's previous vector(keyword) , If you bring back the vectors chuck from your pre-trained space, you only can express pre-defined one. but You are reacting the whole new things. are you concatenate the vectors nearby the vectors which is similar with my input vectors?   It's classic LSTM LLM's definition I guess, And about the Transformer model , It select some token(vector) which is align next to the phrase like Must of Should, and keep that vector 
   

7. explain more about it. Does LSTM cell-state using dataset grouped by EPC code and cell state->cell state means going through row to row while affected by weight in the Same EPC's sequence? and window is cell to cell length? 
> LSTM (The Meticulous Scribe): An LSTM reads the sequence of events one by one, in order. It keeps a "memory" (the cell state) that it updates at each step. It's like a person reading a sentence word by word, trying to remember the beginning by the time they reach the end.

8. In the below context, each event row is like a token in LLM ? row which feature engineered colum are attached one  -> converted as vector -> Transformer compare the importance of it. and give a attention weight on this.  what I am CONFUSING is, llm is pre-trained model, so it have their own attention logic. but if I throw my row into that, how is it works?  and How can visualize attention weight?
> Transformer (The Instantaneous Reader): A Transformer, thanks to its self-attention mechanism, looks at every event in the sequence at the same time. It can directly compare Event #2 with Event #15 without having to "remember" its way through all the steps in between. It instantly calculates the importance of every event relative to every other event.
> Built-in Interpretability via Attention Weights:
The attention mechanism isn't just a performance booster; it's an incredible diagnostic tool. After the Transformer flags an EPC as anomalous, we can visualize the attention weights.
This allows us to ask, "Which events did the model think were the most important when it made this decision?" We might see that it paid huge attention to a massive time gap or a business step regression. This is invaluable for explaining why an anomaly was flagged and is the perfect tool for the "attribution/pinpointing" step we discussed in question #1.
