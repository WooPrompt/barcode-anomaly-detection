# Documentation Update Summary - Event Classification Refinement

## Update Date: 2025-07-16

## Change Summary
**Modified File**: `src/barcode/multi_anomaly_detector.py`
**Function**: `classify_event_type()`
**Change Type**: Event pattern matching optimization

## Technical Details

### Before
```python
outbound_keywords = ['outbound', 'shipping', 'dispatch', 'departure']
```

### After
```python
outbound_keywords = ['outbound']
```

## Impact Analysis

### Accuracy Improvements
- **Reduced False Positives**: More precise event classification in `evtOrderErr` detection
- **Consistent Logic**: Aligns with inbound pattern matching (focused keywords approach)
- **Cleaner Categorization**: Eliminates ambiguity in event type classification

### Performance Benefits
- **Fewer String Comparisons**: Reduced from 4 to 1 keyword comparison per event
- **Streamlined Logic**: Simplified classification function for better maintainability
- **Reduced Overhead**: Less computational cost in event processing pipeline

### System Reliability
- **Enhanced Detection**: More reliable event sequence anomaly detection
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uniform approach across inbound/outbound classification
- **Better Maintainability**: Simplified logic reduces potential for bugs

## Rationale for Change

The original implementation used multiple keywords to identify outbound events, which could lead to:
- **Over-classification**: Events with words like 'shipping' or 'dispatch' in descriptions being incorrectly classified
- **Inconsistency**: Different pattern matching approaches for inbound vs outbound events
- **Performance overhead**: Unnecessary string comparisons

The refined approach ensures that only explicitly labeled 'outbound' events are classified as outbound, improving the reliability of downstream anomaly detection, particularly for `evtOrderErr` (event order error) detection.

## Testing Impact

This change affects the `evtOrderErr` anomaly detection algorithm, which relies on accurate event type classification to identify sequence violations. The refinement should result in:
- More accurate detection of actual event order errors
- Fewer false positives from misclassified events
- Improved overall system reliability

## Future Considerations

- Monitor system performance to validate expected improvements
- Consider similar refinements for other event classification patterns if needed
- Document any additional pattern matching optimizations
